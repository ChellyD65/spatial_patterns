Results and Insight of the Learning Grids Project:

- Our model can lead to grid cells

- Shape of Grid does not depend on trajectory or initial position

- Inhbition should be at least 3 times wider than excitation (rule of thumb)

- Asymetric Gaussians can lead to band structure

- More general inputs (like sum of several Gaussians) can also lead to grids

- Spreading of sigmas between different neurons can still lead to grids. However, spreading in inhibition makes the smaller widths more important (because they can balance in better detail). This leads to an increase of the oscillation frequency (decrease in grid spacing). If the inhibitory width comes in the range (or even below) the width of excitation the grids disappear.
